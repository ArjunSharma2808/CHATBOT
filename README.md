# CHATBOT

This project implements a simple chatbot using machine learning techniques and Streamlit for a web-based interface. The chatbot is designed to respond to various user inputs based on predefined intents, such as greetings, farewells, and other common inquiries. The model uses a TfidfVectorizer to convert text data into numerical features and a Logistic Regression model to classify the user's input into different categories. This allows the chatbot to generate appropriate responses based on the detected intent.
